AINUR SAURON [MK II]
User Options (UO) File
Version=2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that this file isn't needed for Sauron to process. These are just some extra options
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### INSTRUCTIONS ###

Place this file at the root of your sdcard (internal storage)

ENABLE SETTING: set value to 'true' unless told otherwise
DISABLE SETTING: leave it blank or set to 'false' - this applies to ALL options

Reflash is mandatory after setting this file - changes are made during install ONLY
DON'T ASK TO "FIX" ANYTHING IF IT DOESEN'T WORKED FOR YOU!
If something isn't working properly at all (leading to bootloop, or sound loss), you have to find working combination, or don't use UO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### UNIVERSAL OPTIONS ###
FMAS: Installs Fraunhofer "Fmas" virtualizer & downmixer drivers. Replaces &/or extends standard processing effects
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### STABLE QUALCOMM ONLY OPTIONS ###
ASP: Installs Audiosphere SW & HW effect drivers (Qualcomm 3D audio effect)
SHB: Installs Shoebox effect drivers (seems to be a new 3D audio effect from Qualcomm)
RPCM: Installs Reverbwrapper drivers that can apply effect to PCM conversion streams (! UNSTABLE ! might cause bootloops)
APTX: Installs Aptx/HD dirvers & HW offloadable cappi modules, props & Oreo+ ldac & aptx by LazerL0rd (Still needs further testing by you guys)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### EXPERIMENTAL QUALCOMM ONLY OPTIONS ###
YOU MAY EXPERIENCE LOOSING SOUND COMPLETELY AFTER BOOT
Only you can find working combination for these switchers

COMP: Remove comander, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companding
  Current implementation works BOTH for headphones & speakers (won't be separated in MK II)
  ! Might lead to crackling sounds !
RESAMPLE: Resampling feature to force desired discretization
  **You can choose between: KHZ_44P1 - KHZ_192 (from -> to, depending on the numbers your source audio file is)
  Make sure you write it in like KHZ_XXX, where "XXX" means the desired value the "." is written as "P" as in the example below
  Same as bitsize - DO NOT force higher rates for lower source!
  **Ex: qc.resample.khz=KHZ_88P1 (for 88100khz playback)
BTRESAMPLE: Bluetooth Resampling
  Totally Experimental, unexplored & etc
  We also don't know the max value for bluetooth route
  I am aware that it could be limited to 16bit/48000khz
  **Ex: qc.resample.khz=KHZ_48 (for 48000khz playback)
IMPEDANCE: Impedance feature to support native ohms of your headphones
  Might require special kernel support
  ! Highly unstable, might lead to sound loss. NO FIX FOR IT !
  Write it in thousands - like if your headphones are 32Î© it'll be 32000 
  **Ex: qc.impedance=32000
BIT: QC bitsize helps you force stream channel. 32bit is ONLY supported by msm820+
  This is because the qualcomm codec before Aqstic supprts 24\192, thus the processing by CPU can be done in 32bit format, but codec will re-bit the stream down to 24bit
  We don't want this to happen
  You DON'T want to set forced 16/24/32 bitsize on music that is 16bit! Results may end up with cracling & distorted sound
  DO NOT USE if you have any kernel based audio modifications
  **Values can be: 16, 24, or 32
  **Ex: qc.bitsize=24
