# AINUR SAURON [MK II]
# User options file (UO)
# It's not an obligatory move for Sauron to process
#
# Place this file at the root of your sdcard (internal storage)
# TO ENABLE INSTALL SET PROPS TO true
# TO DISABLE JUST SET PROPS TO false, or leave prop blank
# Reflash is mandatory after setting this file - changes
# are made during install ONLY
#
# ! DON'T ASK TO "FIX" ANYTHING IF IT DOESEN'T WORKED FOR YOU!
#
# If something isn't working properly/at all (leading to bootloop, or sound loss) 
# you have to find working combination, or don't use UO


### vv Universal options vv
#
# Install Fraunhofer "Fmas" virtualizer & downmixer drivers
# Replaces &/or extends standard processing effects
install.fmas=

# /System Audio policy configration patching 
# (if you experience any unusual behavior with glitching sound, or complete sound loss - you may wanna set this back to false)

##### vv Qualcomm ONLY options vv
#
# /Vendor Output Audio policy configration patching 
# (if you experience any unusual behavior with glitching sound you may wanna unset this back to false)
# Can be set true or false

#
# Qualcomm 3D audio effect
# Install Audiosphere SW & HW effect drivers
# Can be set true or false

#
# Install Shoebox effect drivers (seems to be a new 3D audio effect from Qualcomm)
# Can be set true or false
qc.install.shoebox=

#
# Install Aptx/HD dirvers & HW offloadable cappi modules & props
# Needs further improvements
# Can be set true or false

## v EXPERIMENTAL v
# ! NOTE !
# YOU MAY EXPERIENCE LOOSING SOUND COMPLETELY AFTER BOOT
# only you can find working combination for theese switchers

#
# Remove compander 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companding
# Current implementation works BOTH for headphones & speakers (won't be separated in MK II)
# ! Might lead to crackling sounds !
# Can be set true or false

#
# QC bitsize helps you force stream channel. 32bit is ONLY supported by msm820+
# that is because the qualcomm codec before Aqstic supprts 24\192, thus the processing by
# CPU can be done in 32bit format, but codec will re-bit the stream down to 24bit
# We don't want this to happen
#
# You DON'T want to set forced 16/24/32 bitsize on music that is 16bit! Results
# May end up with cracling & distorted sound
# Ex: qc.bitsize=24
#
# DO NOT USE if you have any kernel based audio modifications
qc.bitsize=


#
# Resampling feature to force desired discretization
# You can choose between:
# KHZ_44P1 - KHZ_192 (from -> to, depending on the numbers your source audio file is)
# make sure you write it in like KHZ_XXX, where "XXX" means the desired value
# the "." is written as "P" as in the example below
# Ex: qc.resample.khz=KHZ_88P1 for 88100khz playback
# Same as bitsize - DO NOT force higher rates for lower source!
#
# To set native rate - leave blank
qc.resample.khz=


#
# Impedance feature to support native ohms of your headphones 
# Write it in thousands - like if your headphones are 32Î© it'll be 32000 
# Ex: qc.impedance=32000
#
# Might require special kernel support
# ! Highly unstable, might lead to sound loss. NO FIX FOR IT !
#
# To leave native impedance leave blank
qc.impedance=


#
# Bluetooth Resampling
# Totally Experimental, unexplored & etc
# We also don't know the max value for bluetooth route
# I am aware that it could be limited to 16bit/48000khz
#
# Ex: qc.resample.khz=KHZ_48 for 48000khz playback
qc.bt.resample.khz=
